# Attention_is_all_your_business_need

## Bachelor Thesis Project

### Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for my Bachelor's thesis project titled "Attention is All Your Business Needs: A Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews." The project focuses on the application of attention mechanisms in natural language processing (NLP) to analyze customer reviews and derive insights for businesses. This paper showcases the use of deep neural networks, specifically Transformer models, to learn patterns from data. It presents the key roles of self-attention and multi-headed attention in the training of the model in a gradual and detailed manner. The paper concludes with a comparison between a model fully built from scratch and a fine-tuned BERT base uncased model for sentiment analysis.
